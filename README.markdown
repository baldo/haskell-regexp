% Weighted RegExp Matching

Efficient regular expression matching can be beautifully
simple. Revisiting ideas from theoretical computer science, it can be
implemented with linear worst-case time and space bounds in the purely
functional programming language [Haskell].

# Background

# Installation

An implementation of the ideas discussed in the [Play on Regular
Expressions][paper] is available as a Haskell library.

You need to install Haskell in order to use this library. By
installing the [Haskell Platform][Haskell] you get a Haskell compiler
with an interactive environment as well as the package manager
`cabal-install` and various pre-installed packages.
